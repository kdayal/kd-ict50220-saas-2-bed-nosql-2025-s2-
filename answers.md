# How to Answer Questions

Each time you answer a question, fill out the space provided for the answer to the question.

## Answer Requiring an Explanation

Answers to questions should be completed as "block quotes", replacing the `ANSWER_HERE` with the answer, and preceding each line with a greater than sign `>`. To add a new paragraph ensure you leave a `>` with no text after it.

Example:

```markdown
    ## Question Z - How many sofwarte developers does it take to change a lightbulb?
    
    > None. 
	> It is a hardware problem.
```

## Answer Requiring Code

When answering a question that requires code to be included, use a "code block", which starts with three back-ticks (/`) plus the language for the code (e.g. php, js, cpp, python, shell, text, et al).

Example:

```markdown
	## Question X - Title

	Query Solution:

	```js
	db.collection_name.find();
	```
```

> Note: 
>
> The NoSQL code used to answer the question is contained in a code block,wich opens with three back-ticks (\`\`\`) followed by js, contains the code on the lines below, and ends with three back-ticks (\`\`\`) at the start of the next line after the code. An example is shown above.
> 
> It is important that code blocks start at the beginning of the line for formatting on GitHub, Obsidian or your preferred IDE render the code correctly.

## Answer Requiring Image(s) to Be Inserted

Images are to be saved in a folder called "`assets`" and are embedded into the Markdown document.

Images for this assessment MUST be named in the form `step-X-Ya.ext` where:

- `X` is the step number (e.g. for step 5 the number is `5`)
- `Y` is the question dot number (e.g. for question `2.3` the dot number is `3` )
- `a` is an optional letter to allow for multiple images for an answer.
- `ext` is the filename extension (e.g. `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `svg`, et al)

To insert an image use the following syntax:

```markdown
![Short Image Title](./folder/filename.extension)
```

For example, the markdown code:

```markdown
![Embedding an Image Example](./assets/step-N-XXX.png)
```

Gives:

![Embedding an Image Example](assets/step-N-XXX.png)

Query Solution:

```js
	db.collection_name.find();
```

## 11.5 Create trigger for deleted data

- Create a trigger that monitors the movies collection for new data being added.
